## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The dataset is comprehensive and includes many interesting variables for analysis. When looking at this data there were clearly many different angles we could take to pull different trends. There are no doubt many different statistics that could be determined from this particular dataset. Although it may be a little daunting, it provides a lot of room to manipulate the data to not only get results but also practice what we have been learning in class. Of course, the pandemic is ongoing and studying it could not only help us gain a better understanding of it but also provides a jarring truth that this isnâ€™t over. Our primary objective for this data will most likely be to see how the different factors contribute to mortality rates.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data set includes details of covid cases and deaths from all across the US with parameters including age, gender, ethnicity, and state. It includes data from March of 2020 all the way until October of 2021. It was provided by the website [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/md-covid-19-master-case-tracker) and seems to be there simply for public use. There was no specification for who the data was intended for or why it was being collected but there is a clear use for this data. Not only can you split the data into easy sections but it provides a comprehensive outlook on the situation of COVID from an early start. The fact that it also splits the cases into valuable categories makes this dataset not only useful but also interesting.
